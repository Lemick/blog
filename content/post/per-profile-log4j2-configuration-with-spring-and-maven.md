A quick guide to configuring many log4j2 configurations with different profiles (QA, Prodâ€¦).

First, you need to add the log4j2 spring starter, and to exclude the logback starter (here the version is inherited from your Spring Boot BOM).

```xml
<dependency>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <!-- Exclude logback (default implementation) -->
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-logging</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

You can put your ```log4j2-local.xml``` and the ```log4j2-prod.xml``` in the resource directory of your choice, in this example it will be ```src/main/resources/log/```.

Then, you need to define your profile in your ```pom.xml``` with a property which can be used later as a placeholder:
```xml
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>local</id>
        <properties>
            <log4j2.config>log/log4j2-local.xml</log4j2.config>
        </properties>
    </profile>
    <profile>
        <id>prod</id>
        <properties>
            <log4j2.config>log/log4j2-prod.xml</log4j2.config>
        </properties>
    </profile>
</profiles>
```

Finally, you have to add your property placeholder which loads the file from the classpath in your Spring root configuration. It will be replaced at each build with your active profile :)
For exemple in my ```application.yml```:

```yaml
logging:
  config: classpath:${log4j2.config}
```

Note: If you have a specific profile for your unit/integration tests and you want to have a custom log4j2 configuration, the easier way I have found is to put the file in the test resources classpath (```src/test/resources/log/``` for example), thus, it will be taken first by the ```LogManager```.
