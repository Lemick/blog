 **Hello,**

I'm a developer living and working in the south of France. I code mostly in Java and Spring environments, but I like to work with JS and Angular too. When I'm not on my computer, I enjoy playing music !🥁🎸

I love to read tech blogs, so I decided to create mine to talk about things I encounter in my dev'life, share my technological research, and to practice my English writing skills. If it can help someone else, that is cool!
